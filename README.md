## Introduction

The application allows the user to search for books from the Google Books API. The user will then be able to view the title, authors, description, an image of the book title, a link to go to view the book in Google Books, or save the book to a saved database to view later. The user will then be able to view the saved books on the saved books page, or delete the book from the database.
